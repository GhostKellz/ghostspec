# GhostSpec SPECTRA Update â€” RC1 Launch

_Date:_ September 24, 2025  
_Status:_ âœ… RC1 Ready for broader pilot rollout

## Executive Summary
- GhostSpec has exited Beta and entered **Release Candidate 1 (RC1)** with a stability freeze in effect.
- Documentation, contributor processes, and roadmap checkpoints for StageÂ 2 have been satisfied; only RC stabilization items remain.
- The new Zion integration consumes a manifest-driven API (`ghostspec.zion.manifest`) enabling seamless installation, scaffolding, and execution from Zion 0.9.0-rc1.
- Coverage, property, fuzz, and benchmark suites are green with no P0/P1 defects outstanding.

## Stability & Quality Gates
- âœ… Feature freeze declared (only release-blocking fixes accepted).
- âœ… Automated test suite (unit, property, benchmark smoke) passes on Linux x86_64 with Zig 0.11â€“0.14.
- âœ… Coverage target â‰¥ 80% maintained via `tools/run-coverage.sh` (kcov).
- âœ… Changelog and roadmap updated to reflect RC milestones.
- ðŸ”œ Pending: 7-day green streak on nightly regression sweep and cross-platform matrix expansion.

## Zion Integration Highlights
- **Manifest API** â€” `ghostspec.zion.manifest()` exposes version, commands, wrappers, and resource links for Zion to consume without hard-coded strings.
- **Build Helper** â€” `ghostspec.zion.addBuildSteps` registers a `ghostspec-test` top-level step in consumer `build.zig` files.
- **CLI Experience** â€” Zion adds `zion ghostspec` with `install`, `info`, `scaffold`, and `run` subcommands plus optional `gs` alias.
- **Scaffolding** â€” Zion generates `tests/ghostspec_suite.zig` showcasing property, benchmark, and mocking patterns.
- **Documentation Surfacing** â€” Manifest links to architecture, property testing, and this SPECTRA report directly inside Zion.

## Outstanding RC Workstreams
1. **Stability Monitoring** â€” Achieve and document a 7-day green streak across nightly regression runs.
2. **Platform Expansion** â€” Complete Windows/macOS CI shards and ARM64 smoke tests.
3. **Benchmark Sign-off** â€” Finalize comparative benchmarks versus baseline frameworks and publish in docs.
4. **Security Review** â€” Finish dependency audit and threat model validation prior to RC2.

## Action Items for Zion Team
- Ship Zion 0.9.0-rc1 with the new `ghostspec` command enabled by default.
- Encourage users to call `ghostspec.zion.addBuildSteps` in generated project templates.
- Capture feedback from early adopters using the scaffolded suites and feed it back into GhostSpec RC2 planning.

## Try It
```bash
# From Zion repository
zig build install
zion ghostspec info
zion ghostspec install
zion ghostspec scaffold
zion ghostspec run
```
